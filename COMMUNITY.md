## Overview

The Community module lets mentors and mentees connect through threaded discussions. Key features:

- Browse and search discussions with category/sort filters
- Create new discussions with tags
- Comment and reply on discussions
- Like and bookmark discussions
- Pinned discussions (moderator-only) float to the top of the feed
- Locked discussions (moderator-only) prevent new replies and disable interactions

### Key component props

**DiscussionCard**

| Prop         | Type                   | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `discussion` | `DiscussionMetadata`   | Discussion data including `isPinned`, `isLocked`           |
| `onLike`     | `(id: string) => void` | Called when like button is clicked (no-op when locked)     |

| `onClick`    | `(id: string) => void` | Called when the card is clicked/Enter-pressed              |

**DiscussionMetadata**

| Prop                  | Type                   | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata`            | `DiscussionMetadata`   | Source data                                                      |
| `onLike`              | `(id: string) => void` | Like handler                                                     |

## Routing Structure

| Route             | Component                                 | Description                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/community`      | `app/(dashboard)/community/page.tsx`      | Discussion feed + sidebar    |
| `/community/[id]` | `app/(dashboard)/community/[id]/page.tsx` | Discussion detail + comments |

Both routes are nested inside `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`, which wraps the page in the shared dashboard shell (navigation, etc.).

The community layout at `app/(dashboard)/community/layout.tsx` wraps its children in `CommunityProvider` so all nested pages share the same state.

---

## State Management

State lives in `CommunityContext` (`community-context.tsx`) using `useReducer`.

### Shape

```ts
interface CommunityState {
  discussions: Discussion[]; // includes isPinned, isLocked
  categories: Category[];
  filters: {
    sortBy: DiscussionSort; // 'trending' | 'latest' | 'most-replies' | 'most-liked'
    category: string | null;
    searchQuery: string;
  };
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  recommended: Discussion[];
  statistics: {
    totalMembers;
    activeDiscussions;
    totalDiscussions;
    eventsThisMonth;
  };
}
```

### Available actions (via context methods)

| Method                                 | Purpose                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setSortBy(sort)`                      | Change sort order                                                         |
| `setCategoryFilter(category)`          | Filter by category; `null` = all                                          |
| `setSearchQuery(query)`                | Text search filter                                                        |
| `addDiscussion(discussion)`            | Prepend a new discussion                                                  |
| `updateDiscussionLikes(id, likes)`     | Update like count                                                         |
| `updateDiscussionReplies(id, replies)` | Update reply count                                                        |
| `togglePin(id)`                        | Toggle `isPinned` on a discussion                                         |
| `toggleLock(id)`                       | Toggle `isLocked` on a discussion                                         |
| `getFilteredDiscussions()`             | Returns discussions with filters, sort, and pinned-first ordering applied |

### Pinned-first ordering

`getFilteredDiscussions()` applies category, search, and sort filters first, then does a stable secondary sort that moves all `isPinned === true` discussions to the top. This means the primary sort order is preserved within the pinned and unpinned groups.

---

## API Integration Points

API calls are in `lib/community-service.ts`. All methods use a shared `request<T>()` helper that reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from environment variables.

| Method                     | HTTP   | Endpoint                                  | Description               |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `likeDiscussion(id)`       | POST   | `/api/community/discussions/:id/like`     | Like a discussion         |
| `unlikeDiscussion(id)`     | DELETE | `/api/community/discussions/:id/like`     | Remove a like             |
| `bookmarkDiscussion(id)`   | POST   | `/api/community/discussions/:id/bookmark` | Bookmark a discussion     |
| `removeBookmark(id)`       | DELETE | `/api/community/discussions/:id/bookmark` | Remove a bookmark         |
| `fetchDiscussions(params)` | GET    | `/api/community/discussions`              | Paginated discussion list |

### Next.js API route (mock)

`app/api/discussions/` contains the local API route used during development. The community page currently populates state from `CommunityContext`'s initial mock data, not from this route.

### Realtime events

`lib/realtime-discussion.ts` exports `createRealtimeConnection(url, onEvent)` which opens a WebSocket and emits typed `RealtimeEvent` objects. Event types:

- `discussion:new` — a new discussion was created
- `discussion:update` — a discussion was edited
- `discussion:delete` — a discussion was deleted
- `like` — a like was added
- `comment:new` — a new comment was posted

The connection auto-reconnects on close (3-second delay). The returned function tears the connection down.

## Pin & Lock Features

### Pinned discussions

- `isPinned: boolean` on `DiscussionMetadata` / `Discussion`
- Pinned cards display a cyan **Pinned** badge and a left cyan border
- `getFilteredDiscussions()` always sorts pinned items before unpinned items
- Moderators see **Pin / Unpin** toggle buttons on the discussion detail page (`data-testid="pin-toggle-button"`)

### Locked discussions

- `isLocked: boolean` on `DiscussionMetadata` / `Discussion`
- Locked cards display an amber **Locked** badge and a notice: "This discussion is locked — no new replies."
- Like and bookmark buttons are `disabled` and callbacks are suppressed
- On the detail page, the comment textarea is hidden and replaced with a locked notice (`data-testid="locked-comment-notice"`)
- Moderators see **Lock / Unlock** toggle buttons (`data-testid="lock-toggle-button"`)

### Moderator role

`CURRENT_USER_IS_MODERATOR` in `app/(dashboard)/community/[id]/page.tsx` controls whether the pin/lock controls are shown. In production this should come from an auth context (e.g. the current user's role from a JWT claim or session).

---

## Testing

Tests live in `__tests__/community/` and use **Jest 30** + **React Testing Library**.

### Setup

```bash
npm test              # run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # watch mode
npm run test:coverage # with coverage report
```

Configuration: `jest.config.ts` (uses `next/jest.js`), setup file: `jest.setup.ts`.

### Test files

| File                          | Type        | What it covers                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DiscussionCard.test.tsx`     | Unit        | Rendering, pin badge, lock badge, aria-labels, click/keydown             |
| `DiscussionMetadata.test.tsx` | Unit        | Stats display, like/bookmark callbacks, `disableInteractions`, `timeAgo` |
| `CommunityTabs.test.tsx`      | Unit        | Rendering, `aria-current`, count badges, tab switching                   |
| `FilterBar.test.tsx`          | Unit        | Search input, sort select, clear-filters button                          |
| `DiscussionFeed.test.tsx`     | Integration | Empty state, pagination, load-more, like/bookmark/click callbacks        |
| `PinLock.test.tsx`            | Integration | Pin/lock visual output across DiscussionCard and DiscussionFeed          |

### Writing new tests

1. Place test files in `__tests__/community/` or alongside the component as `ComponentName.test.tsx`.
2. Mock `@/components/Avatar` and `@/components/CategoryBadge` when testing community components — they're not under test and add noise.
3. When a component renders both an `<article role="button">` and `<button>` elements, use `getByRole('button', { name: /discussion:/i })` to target the card specifically (the card's `aria-label` always starts with `"Discussion: "`).
4. Use `data-testid` attributes (`pin-badge`, `lock-badge`, `locked-notice`, `moderator-controls`, etc.) for structural assertions.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Adding a new community component

1. Create the component in `components/community/`.
2. Export only named types from `lib/community-types.ts` — don't add business logic there.
3. If the component needs global state, add it to `CommunityContext` via a new action type and reducer case.
4. Write unit tests covering the happy path, edge cases (empty/undefined props), and accessibility attributes.

### Modifying state shape

1. Update the `Discussion` or `DiscussionMetadata` interface in `lib/community-types.ts` and `community-context.tsx`.
2. Add a new `Action` union member and handle it in `communityReducer`.
3. Expose a new method on `CommunityContextType` and implement it in the provider.
4. Update any mock data in `[id]/page.tsx` that uses the affected type.

### Adding a moderator action

1. Add the relevant toggle to `CommunityContext` (see `TOGGLE_PIN` / `TOGGLE_LOCK` as examples).
2. Add the UI control to the detail page guarded by the moderator check.
3. Add integration tests in `PinLock.test.tsx` covering the visual output and callback suppression.
4. When the real backend is available, wire the action to a `communityService` method.

### Coding standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode; no `any`.
- Keep components pure/functional — side effects belong in event handlers or `useEffect`.
- Tailwind only — no inline styles.
- All interactive elements must have an `aria-label` when the label isn't evident from content.
- Disabled buttons must use the `disabled` HTML attribute (not just visual styling) so assistive technology and tests can detect the state.
